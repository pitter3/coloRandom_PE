// ITERATION 0:

// HTML to layout the structure of the page. We need a HEADER(h1), MAIN<main>.
// Question: How do we turn a randomly generated number into a hex code?
// Use flexbox to orgnaize Header and Main.
// Can we use labels (like we did with radio buttons) for our color box text display.
// 

// ITERATION 1: 

// Button shape is weird-- we will have to use border radius.
// Data model for our hex codes.
// We will need the to index our data model and set colors based on its contents.
// Each box will represent an index position in our data model array. Box 1 is 0, Box 2 is 1.....
// We will need have each box read its index position and set itself to the color it is reading.

// ITERATION 2:

// We will need to add images to our boxes that have event listeners on click.
// A conditional that only clears our data model if the box is unlocked.
// If box is locked do not clear out the data model in that index position.
// Question: Can we use a for loop + a conditional for this?

// ITERATION 3: 

// Build Saved palettes section with CSS + HTML 
// Question: is this an HTML aside??
// New Data Model array for saved palettes section
// Event Listener on Save Palette button to push original Data Model contents into new one.
// Style mini boxes
// !!similar to savedCovers from our paired project!!

// ITERATION 4:

// Splice our data model when we click the X.
// Add the X next to our saved palettes.
// Add event listener to the X.
// Remove palette tied to the proper X.
